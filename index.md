## Our Game
  
Our team is currently developing a 2D Platforming Puzzle game centered around the manipulation of gravity. In our early concepts, the game currently has the following features:
  
  1. Fast paced movement
  2. Grappling hook for movement
  3. Player-manipulated orbital forces
  4. Obsticles and puzzles that players must navigate quickly with the tools at their disposal.
